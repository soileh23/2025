So this is what I’d call your 2025, from my lens.
Anika, you had your ups and downs this year, and this is just a small attempt to capture them; not objectively, not completely, just the way I saw them.

Chal… ek kahaani sunata hoon:

There was a girl.
Bholi bhaali si… (of course not, andar se badi shaani hai)
She came to a new city. New people. New life. First time away from home, away from family. Stepping into her dream company, Apple, as an intern. Excited. Nervous. Hopeful. Scared. All at once.

January 13th: Her first day at Apple. A quiet day. She mostly observed. Met people. Took it all in. All good?

But life, of course, never runs in a straight line.

Her flatmates turned out to be… let’s say Blessed Intensive Training in Character & Humility (BITCHes).
Those two would test her patience for the next six months, but we won’t focus on them, because this story isn’t about side villains.
It’s about our protagonist. Miss main character. Anika.

Somewhere in the middle of this new city and chaos, she also found me.
Originally Aditya. Then Prashant for a day. Then Pentu for a while. And finally Adi.
She became really friends with me, but again, not about me. This is her story.

And bro… she fought through everything.
Mini team-change trauma. Flatmate battles. Office politics. Overthinking. Self-doubt.

But in the middle of all this I saw her grow.

I saw her grow from “I’m a nervous speaker” to being one of the smoothest voices in the room during presentations
From “I’ll just bare with my flatmates” to “I’ll deal with them my way”
I have seen her taking work lightly to sitting for hours to finish what she started.

She didn’t just deserve that offer, she earned it.

Fun fact: madam was so committed to finishing her work that one day she stayed so late in office that a root mail went to the entire floor reminding everyone that late sittings aren’t allowed 😭
Keynotes so good that people actually took inspiration from her slides.

Madam ka target tha: 3 months, no outfit repeats.
Every day, a new look. Fashion discipline on another level.

Internship was going smoothly. Good feedback. Everything was nice.

And then came May 19th.
Lavender kurti. Good day. Positive hints about the offer.
And then suddenly, “Naveen’s team doesn’t have requirements.”

I saw her almost shatter that day.

She cried. A lot.
I felt helpless.

June 5th: She nailed her final presentation like a boss.
Walked out a winner.
Got the offer. At her dream company.

After that, new flat, slightly better flatmates, new manager, new chapter.
Gopu left as manager, iPod entered the story.

She even trained a complete novice (me) so that someone could make her okay-ish food when she’s hungry.

And outside of work…
She built a home.
Shifted houses. Set everything up.
Kept things clean. Organized. Maintained.

She didn’t just learn how to live alone.
She mastered it.

And yes, RCB finally won.
So obviously 2025 is historically important.

So that’s the story of a girl who stepped out of her home for the first time… and absolutely nailed it.

And now… directly to you.

Anika, you were amazing. Absolute legend.

You didn’t turn cold.
You stayed warm in a world that often pushes you to shut down.

So yes.

Cheers to an incredible year.
Bye 2025.
And thank you Anika… for being the kind of person whose year was beautiful enough to write a story about 🤍
