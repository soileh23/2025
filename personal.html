Anika’s 2025 — Through My Lens
So this is what I’d call your 2025, from my lens. Anika, you had your ups and downs this year, and this is just a small attempt to capture them; not objectively, not completely, just the way I saw them.
Chal… ek kahaani sunata hoon: 
There was a girl. Bholi bhaali si… (of course not, andar se badi shaani hai) She came to a new city. New people. New life. First time away from home, away from family. Stepping into her dream company, Apple, as an intern. Excited. Nervous. Hopeful. Scared. All at once.
January 13th: Her first day at Apple. A quiet day. She mostly observed. Met people. Took it all in. All good?
But life, of course, never runs in a straight line.
Her flatmates turned out to be… let’s say Blessed Intensive Training in Character & Humility (BITCHes). Those two would test her patience for the next six months, but we won’t focus on them, because this story isn’t about side villains. It’s about our protagonist. Miss main character. Anika.
Somewhere in the middle of this new city and chaos, she also found me. Originally Aditya. Then Prashant for a day. Then Pentu for a while. And finally Adi. She became really friends with me, but again, not about me. This is her story.
And bro… she fought through everything. Mini team-change trauma. Flatmate battles. Office politics. Overthinking. Self-doubt.
But in the middle of all this I saw her grow.
I saw her grow from “I’m a nervous speaker” to being one of the smoothest voices in the room during presentations From “I’ll just bare with my flatmates” to “I’ll deal with them my way” I have seen her taking work lightly to sitting for hours to finish what she started.
She didn’t just deserve that offer, she earned it.
Fun fact: madam was so committed to finishing her work that one day she stayed so late in office that a root mail went to the entire floor reminding everyone that late sittings aren’t allowed 😭 Keynotes so good that people actually took inspiration from her slides. But of course… PPO was not the only target.
Madam ka target tha: 3 months, no outfit repeats. Every day, a new look. Fashion discipline on another level. Spoiler alert: she did nail it, aise hi thodi na she is the OG eye candy. 
Internship was going smoothly. Good feedback. Everything was nice.
And then came May 19th.
Lavender kurti. Good day. Positive hints about the offer. And then suddenly, “Naveen’s team doesn’t have requirements.”
I saw her almost shatter that day.
She cried. A lot. I felt helpless. All that hard work, all that growth, it couldn’t go to waste. That wouldn’t be fair.
And it didn’t.
June 5th: She nailed her final presentation like a boss. Walked out a winner. Got the offer. At her dream company.
(Also side effect: ghar pe itna positive aura gaya ki uncle also upgraded his job. Queen behaviour only.)
After that, new flat, slightly better flatmates (still not great, but improvement is improvement), new manager, new chapter.
Gopu left as manager, iPod entered the story, and honestly, if anyone can make part 2 work as well as part 1, it’s her. 
Btw this year also elevated her MasterChef mode:
Rice paper dumplings. Zucchini ravioli. Paneer tikka rolls. And of course, mutton… sorry… rajma kebabs.
She even trained a complete novice (me) so that someone could make her okay-ish food when she’s hungry.
Well talking about teaching she also surprised me by becoming a quiet leader: teaching dance, patiently guiding everyone, coordinating, encouraging. For someone who usually takes the backseat, she showed a calm, strong leadership that honestly made me very proud.  Not sure about those people I will always be grateful to her for having us help pull off that amazing performance, thanks!!

And outside of work…
She built a home.
Shifted houses. Set everything up. Kept things clean. Organized. Maintained. From wardrobe to kitchen, everything in place.
She didn’t just learn how to live alone. She mastered it.
And yes, as if all this wasn’t enough, RCB finally won. So obviously 2025 is historically important.
So that’s the story of a girl who stepped out of her home for the first time… and absolutely nailed it.
Told from the lens of someone who used to be her closest friend, and still cares deeply, but again, not about me.
It’s about how this year shaped her.

And now… directly to you.
Anika, you were amazing. Absolute legend.
This might sound random, but your year genuinely feels like a crossover episode of all the shows you watched:

At some point you became like Belly(TSITP), standing at that place where everything changes, where you realise feelings are deeper than you thought, that some things hurt more than you expected(Yes referring to to the night when you were worried about not ever having friends), and that you’re not the same person you were. That quiet emotional growing-up, that bittersweet shift, you lived that. 
Then there are phase that felt straight out of Bigg Boss, when situations were loud, messy, unfair, and emotionally exhausting (Yes flatmates and office). Where people reacted instead of reflected, and you had to learn when to speak, when to stay silent, and when to just protect your own peace like someone trying to survive a nomination week without losing themselves. Tu kabhi gaurav bani toh kabhi kunika but you didn’t become Farhana (cruel), you didn’t become Tanya(petty), you didn’t lose your dignity. You just became stronger. 

Well you also had your Bastards of Bollywood moment, when you saw through things that look shiny on the outside but are hollow or unhealthy underneath (Yes work and maybe someone else, but that someone can never be hollow for you). Like when the curtain lifts and you realise the story isn’t as beautiful as the trailer promised.

 But ye chodh, what I love the most is that you didn’t turn cold. 

You still kept your Brooklyn 99 energy, like Amy growing into confidence, Rosa softening without losing strength, Jake learning responsibility without losing joy. You found humour in heavy days. You let people in. You stayed warm in a world that often pushes you to shut down. (Had to research a lot for this you know, show hi nhi dekha)
   And finally, you became a little like Ted from How I Met Your Mother (you might not agree, but id just like to believe so), still believing in meaning, in timing, in that idea that even the wrong chapters are part of the right story. That heartbreaks don’t make the story pointless, they just make it deeper.

So yes.
Cheers to an incredible year. Bye 2025.
And thank you Anika… for being the kind of person whose year was beautiful enough to write a story about 🤍
